 1. Import project from Github: 

      
        File -> Import -> Git -> Projects From Git > URI

        Enter the Github repository url

        Select the branch
        
        Choose option: as general project

    
 2. Open the .project xml file in the project folder in Eclipse. 

    Search for <natures></natures> and change it to 
        <natures><nature>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature</nature></natures> 
    and save the file

    Right click the src folder, go to Build Path... and click Use as Source Folder

 3. If you still have troubles running the project (something like "main class not found"), 
    make sure the <buildSpec> inside the .project file is set (as described here):

      <buildSpec>
         <buildCommand>
             <name>org.eclipse.jdt.core.javabuilder</name>
             <arguments>
             </arguments>
         </buildCommand>
     </buildSpec>
